"""Tests for MLX timestamp conversion logic.

This suite contains:
- Unit tests for the internal _json_to_srt() conversion using synthetic MLX-style
  segment data (list format: [start_seek, end_seek, text]).
- A dictionary format regression test (old format path).
- An optional integration test (Mac ARM only) that runs the MLX backend on the
  existing test audio and compares the last subtitle end time to the true WAV
  duration.

The fix for Issue #1 has been applied - the correct 0.01 seconds per frame
conversion factor is now used for MLX list-format segments.
